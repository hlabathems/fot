Guide of python scripts

Source files: these contain functions used in simulations

  drw_lightcurve.py
    It contains the functions that generate a light curve given quasar parameters sigma, tau, and b.

  qsr_ll.py
    This is a source file. This contains the hojjati and kelly likelihood functions for a single quasar light curve.

  hubble_observation_schedule.py
    This is a source file. It contains a function that provides a randmoized hubble-like schedule. It is not currently being used in any of the files but that will change.

  delayed_lightcurve.py
    The is a source file. It takes the observation schedule and image delay to produce two delayed lightcurves.  I still have to add the magnitude offset.

Tests and examples: these contain example applications and tests of the functions in the source files.

  test_drw_lightcurve.py
    This function tests the drw_lightcurve.py There are three tests. You can select which one to run at the bottom of the script.

  sim_lightcurve_examples.py
    This produces examples of simulated light curves using drw_lightcurve.py. 

  lightcurve_ll_plots.py
    This is a test function of qsr_ll.py It produces plots of the likelihood function for sigma and tau parameters for a simulated lightcurve using drw_lightcurve.py. This will be updated to produce triangle plots.

  emcee_light_curves.py
    emcee reconstruction of light curve parameters.

  test_delayed_lightcurve.py
    Provide examples of the functions in delayed_lightcurve.py.


Coming soon.
  Likelihood functions for delayed light curves.
  Emcee tests for reconstruction of light curve delays and parameters.
